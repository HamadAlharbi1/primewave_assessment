# Task 4: Architecture Choice for News-Feed App in Low-Connectivity Regions

## Decision: Offline-First Approach

**Choice**: Offline-first with local database and background sync.

## Justification

For a news-feed app in low-connectivity regions, **offline-first** is the superior choice because:

1. **Reliability**: Users can access cached news even during network outages
2. **Performance**: Instant loading from local storage eliminates network latency
3. **Data Efficiency**: Batch syncing reduces bandwidth usage compared to continuous WebSocket connections
4. **Battery Life**: Periodic sync consumes less power than persistent WebSocket connections
5. **Cost**: Reduces mobile data usage, critical in regions with expensive data plans

## Three Concrete Risks with Mitigations

### Risk 1: Stale Data Display
**Problem**: Users see outdated news when sync fails or is delayed.
**Mitigation**: Implement smart sync strategies with timestamps, show "last updated" indicators, and prioritize critical updates (breaking news) for immediate sync.

### Risk 2: Storage Limitations
**Problem**: Local database grows large, consuming device storage and affecting performance.
**Mitigation**: Implement LRU cache eviction, compress stored content, limit cache size (e.g., 50MB), and provide user controls to manage storage.

### Risk 3: Sync Conflicts and Data Integrity
**Problem**: Multiple devices or concurrent updates cause data inconsistencies.
**Mitigation**: Use conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins with timestamps), implement optimistic locking, and maintain audit trails for critical data changes.

## Implementation Strategy

- **Local Storage**: SQLite with indexed articles, images, and metadata
- **Sync Strategy**: Background sync every 15-30 minutes, with immediate sync for breaking news
- **Conflict Resolution**: Server-timestamp-based resolution with client-side conflict detection
- **Offline Indicators**: Clear UI feedback showing sync status and data freshness

This approach ensures reliable news access while optimizing for the constraints of low-connectivity environments.
